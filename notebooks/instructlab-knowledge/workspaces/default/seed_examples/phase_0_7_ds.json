Despite these safeguards, there may be instances where your account has a negative balance without incurring overdraft fees. This can occur through various means, such as:\n\n1. If you have previously authorized overdraft transactions, like checks or recurring debit card payments, they may still be processed, resulting in a negative balance.\n2. If you have opted in for overdraft protection, linked to another account or a line of credit, and there are insufficient funds in the primary account, overdraft fees from the secondary account may apply.\n3. If you have a negative balance due to bank errors or adjustments, no overdraft fee will be charged.\n\nIt is essential to monitor your account balance and set up alerts to prevent unexpected negative balances and potential merchant fees.",
