{"messages":[{"content":"Document:\nNo bank overdraft fees\nWe don't charge overdraft fees on this account. To help you avoid overdrawing your account, transactions will be declined and returned unpaid when you don't have enough money in your account.\n\u00b7 If this happens, you won't be charged a bank overdraft fee, but the merchant or third party could charge you a fee. For example, you may be charged a late fee if the payment isn't received on time.\n\u00b7 An owner can set up email or mobile alerts to notify you when you have a low balance in your account or when items aren't paid. (We don't charge for this service but your mobile carrier's message and data fees may apply. Delivery of alerts may be affected or delayed by your mobile carrier's coverage.)\nWhile this account prevents you from overdrawing in most cases, there may still be times when your account could have a negative balance, but we won't charge an overdraft fee. This could happen in the following ways:\n\n\nDocument:\nThe method of posting transactions to your account by the bank affects your account balance. At the end of each business day, transactions received that day are categorized and then posted. The common categories and typical transactions within each are listed in the order they generally post to your account:\n\n1. Deposits: These are added to your account from the highest to the lowest dollar amount.\n2. Many debit transactions: These are subtracted based on the date and time you made them. If the bank's system does not receive the date and time of the transaction, they are posted and subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. This category includes one-time and recurring debit card transactions, one-time transfers, and ATM withdrawals.\n3. Most other electronic payments and preauthorized transfers: These are subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amount. This category includes scheduled transfers, online bill payments, and preauthorized payments that use your account number.\n4. Most fees: These are also subtracted from highest to lowest dollar amounts.\n\nIt is important to note that transactions that are still processing may lower your available balance. Additionally, paper checks are not compatible with this account.\n\n\nDocument:\nThis account does not impose overdraft fees. If you lack sufficient funds, transactions will be declined to prevent overdrafts, avoiding bank overdraft fees. However, merchants or third parties might charge you fees, such as late fees if payments are not received on time. Account owners can set up email or mobile alerts for low balances or unpaid items, a free service, although mobile carrier fees may apply. Despite these safeguards, there may be instances where your account has a negative balance without incurring overdraft fees. This can occur through various means, such as:\n\n1. If you have previously authorized overdraft transactions, like checks or recurring debit card payments, they may still be processed, resulting in a negative balance.\n2. If you have opted in for overdraft protection, linked to another account or a line of credit, and there are insufficient funds in the primary account, overdraft fees from the secondary account may apply.\n3. If you have a negative balance due to bank errors or adjustments, no overdraft fee will be charged.\n\nIt is essential to monitor your account balance and set up alerts to prevent unexpected negative balances and potential merchant fees.\n\n\nDocument:\nThe document highlights the policy of no bank overdraft fees for a specific account. If an account lacks sufficient funds, transactions will be declined to prevent overdrawing. Although this prevents bank overdraft fees, merchants or third parties might charge fees for returned unpaid transactions. For instance, a late fee may be incurred if a payment is not received on time.\n\nThe account holder can set up email or mobile alerts for low balances or unpaid items. No charges apply for this service from the bank, but mobile carrier fees for messages and data may apply. Delivery of alerts can be impacted by the mobile carrier's coverage.\n\nDespite the account's prevention of overdrawing in most cases, there are still potential scenarios where the account could show a negative balance without incurring an overdraft fee.
